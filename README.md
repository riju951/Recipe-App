## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for recipes by entering the name of a dish. The app then queries TheMealDB API to retrieve relevant recipes.
- **Detailed Recipes**: For each search query, the app displays the recipe's name, origin, an image, ingredients required, and step-by-step cooking instructions.
- **Responsive Design**: Crafted with mobile-first design principles in mind, the app ensures optimal usability on both desktops and mobile devices.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The clean and minimalistic UI, powered by the "Poppins" Google Font and custom CSS, enhances readability and user interaction.

## How It Works

1. **Entering a Dish Name**: The user inputs the name of a dish into the search field.
2. **Fetching the Recipe**: Upon clicking the search button, the app calls TheMealDB API with the dish name.
3. **Displaying the Results**: The app parses the JSON response from the API and displays the recipe image, name, origin, and ingredients on the page.
4. **Viewing Full Recipe**: Users can click on "View Recipe" to see detailed cooking instructions.

## Technical Stack

- **HTML**: Structures the app's content and layout.
- **CSS**: Styles the app, including layout adjustments for mobile responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the app's interactivity, handling API requests and dynamically updating the UI based on user inputs and API responses.
